# Task ID: 15
# Title: Optimize Database Queries for Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement proper indexing and optimize database queries for better performance.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Existing Database Queries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review and profile current Prisma-based SQLite/SQL queries to identify performance bottlenecks and inefficient patterns such as N+1 query problems.
### Details:
Use Prisma's built-in query logging and profiling tools to gather metrics on query execution times and frequency. Identify queries related to message history and tool call persistence that are slow or redundant.

## 2. Implement Proper Indexing Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Design and apply appropriate database indexes on frequently queried columns to speed up data retrieval in SQLite/SQL databases used by the Prisma application.
### Details:
Based on the analysis, create indexes on columns involved in WHERE clauses, JOINs, and ORDER BY operations, especially for tables storing message history and tool call data. Validate index effectiveness by measuring query performance improvements.

## 3. Optimize Prisma Queries Using Include and Select [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Refactor Prisma queries to use Include and Select features effectively to reduce data over-fetching and minimize the number of database calls.
### Details:
Modify queries to fetch related data in a single query using Include, and limit retrieved fields with Select to only those necessary. This reduces latency and payload size, addressing common N+1 problems and improving overall query efficiency.

## 4. Set Up Performance Monitoring and Use Prisma Optimize Tool [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Implement ongoing performance monitoring and utilize Prisma Optimize AI to gain insights and receive recommendations for further query optimization.
### Details:
Integrate Prisma Optimize locally to analyze query metrics and get AI-driven suggestions. Continuously monitor query performance for message history and tool call persistence to proactively identify and resolve new bottlenecks.
