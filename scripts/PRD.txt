# Risks and Mitigations  

## Technical Challenges

### AI Integration Complexity
- **Risk:** LangChain/LangGraph integration complexity may cause development delays
- **Mitigation:** Start with simple agent workflows and incrementally add complexity; maintain comprehensive test coverage with fakes for external dependencies

### Database Performance
- **Risk:** Tool call persistence and message history queries may impact performance at scale
- **Mitigation:** Implement proper database indexing, optimize queries with selective loading, and monitor performance metrics; use database query optimization techniques

### Context Window Limitations
- **Risk:** Large conversation histories may exceed AI model context windows
- **Mitigation:** Implement conversation summarization, selective history inclusion, and context window management strategies

## MVP Definition and Scope

### Feature Creep Risk
- **Risk:** Attempting to build all features simultaneously may delay MVP delivery
- **Mitigation:** Strict adherence to phase-based development; Phase 1-2 constitute the MVP with basic bot and AI functionality

### Tool Call Persistence Complexity
- **Risk:** Tool call message linkage implementation may be more complex than anticipated
- **Mitigation:** Break down into smaller, testable components; implement atomic persistence first, then add linkage functionality

- **Mitigation:** Implement fallback mechanisms, error handling, and multiple AI provider support; maintain API version compatibility

## Resource Constraints

### Development Time Management
- **Risk:** Complex AI features may require more development time than estimated
- **Mitigation:** Focus on core functionality first; use existing LangChain patterns and tools rather than custom implementations

### Testing Complexity
- **Risk:** AI and external service testing may be difficult to implement comprehensively
- **Mitigation:** Extensive use of fakes and mocks for external dependencies; focus on testing business logic and integration points

### Deployment and Infrastructure
- **Risk:** Production deployment complexity may delay launch
- **Mitigation:** Start with simple deployment strategies; use SQLite for development and proven database solutions for production

## Quality and Reliability

### Code Quality Maintenance
- **Risk:** Rapid development may compromise code quality and maintainability
- **Mitigation:** Strict adherence to TypeScript best practices, comprehensive test coverage, and automated CI/CD checks

### Error Handling Coverage
- **Risk:** AI and external service errors may not be handled gracefully
- **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive error handling patterns, user-friendly error messages, and proper logging/monitoring

### Data Consistency
- **Risk:** Tool call persistence and message linkage may create data inconsistencies
- **Mitigation:** Atomic database operations, proper transaction management, and data validation at all persistence points
