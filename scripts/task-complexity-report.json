      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of tool call messages in MessageHistoryService into detailed subtasks covering service modification, query logic update, backward compatibility, performance optimization, code structuring, and testing strategies.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple complex aspects including modifying service logic to integrate new message types, ensuring correct chronological ordering, maintaining backward compatibility, optimizing performance for potentially large data sets, and comprehensive testing (unit, integration, regression, performance, manual). The dependency on another task and the need to handle various conversation patterns add to the complexity, warranting a moderately high complexity score and multiple subtasks for clear implementation and testing phases."
